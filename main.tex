%=== NOTES TO FUTURE USERS ===%
% Inside ufdissertation.cls you'll find this custom environment command:
% \begin{multiFigure}
%     \centering
%     \addFigure{0.96}{path/to/fig}
%     \captionof{figure}
%         []
%         {}
%     \label{fig:X}
% \end{multiFigure}
% * Make sure that there is NOT A NEWLINE between \begin{multiFigure} and the line ABOVE it (otherwise your figs will be off-center)!

%=== Rules on CAPITALIZATION ===%
% Title Case: all principal words are capitalized except prepositions, articles, and conjunctions.
% Sentence Case: Normal sentence rules.

% Ch. 1: CHAPTER TITLES ARE ALL CAPS
% Sec. 1.2: Section Titles Are in Title Case
% Subsec. 1.2.3: Subsection Titles Are in Title Case
% Subsubsec. 1.2.3.4: Subsubsection titles are in sentence case
% Any header levels beyond subsubsections should just use bold text and should not be numbered.

%=== N.B.: If you want to use biblatex, go into ufdissertation.cls and search for 'biblatex' (un)comment instructions.
% \usepackage[sorting=none, backend=biber, style=phys, biblabel=brackets]{biblatex}
% \usepackage[sorting=none]{biblatex}

% Enable format for table, figure, object
\haveTablestrue%        Uncomment this if you have tables in your thesis.
\haveFigurestrue%       Uncomment this if you have figures in your thesis.
%\haveObjectstrue%       Uncomment this if you have Objects in your thesis. This is almost certainly not the case however.

%%% Below are the commands to set the degree type, department, graduation time, and chair. 
%       Most of these are self explanatory. 
%       Note: The \chair command takes an optional argument for a cochair. 
%           So if John was your chair and Jacob was a cochair, you would use \chair[Jacob]{John}.
%           If John was your chair and you had no cochair, you can simply use \chair{John}.

% Author info
\title{Precision Measurement of the Higgs Boson Mass and Search for Dilepton Mass Resonances in $\htofourl$ Decays Using the CMS Detector at the LHC}
\degreeType{Doctor of Philosophy}         % Official name of your degree; eg "Doctorate of Philosophy".
\major{Physics}                              % Your official Department.
\author{Jake Rosenzweig}%                  Your Name
\thesisType{Dissertation}%              Dissertation (PhD) or Thesis (Masters)
\degreeYear{2022}%                      Intended graduation year (not the year you submit the thesis)
\degreeMonth{December}%                   Month of graduation should be May, August, or December.
\chair[Guenakh Mitselmakher]{Andrey Korytov}%                   Chair and Cochair (see comment block above).

%% additional sections
% \setDedicationFile{tex/dedicationFile}%                Dedication Page
% \setAcknowledgementsFile{tex/acknowledgementsFile}%    Acknowledgements Page
% \setBiographicalFile{tex/biographyFile}%               Biography file of the Author (you).
% \setAbstractFile{tex/abstractFile}%                    Abstract Page (This should only include the abstract itself)

%=== Bibliography is printed in the command \setReferenceFile below. ===%
% \bibliographystyle{plain}
% \bibliography{referenceFile}
\setReferenceFile{referenceFile}{jhep}%        References. First argument is your bibtex source file (.bib) the second argument is your bibtex style file (.bst).
% \setReferenceFile{referenceFile}{amsplain}
% Use the style "unsrtnat" since it sorts references in cite order and shows url.
% Other bibliographystyles: unsrtnat, apsrev, ieeetr, jhep (beautiful but doesn't show url).

%%%% These are NOT required, so only use them if you actually need/have them.
% \setAbbreviationsFile{tex/abbreviations}%           Abbreviations Page. Jake changed this to say "LIST OF ACRONYMS".
% \setAppendixFile{tex/appendix}%                     Appendix Content; hyperlinking might be weird. TODO: Fix hyperlinking.
% \multipleAppendixtrue%                          Uncomment this if you have more than one appendix, otherwise leave it commented. This adds "A", "B" in the TOC next to each Appendix entry.
