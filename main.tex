\usepackage{tikz}%       tikz is used by almost everyone, but certainly by me for this.
\usepackage[compat=1.1.0]{tikz-feynman}% for drawing feynman diagrams 
\usepackage{pgfplots}%   pgfplots is tikz but better.

% Enable format for table, figure, object
\haveTablestrue%        Uncomment this if you have tables in your thesis.
\haveFigurestrue%       Uncomment this if you have figures in your thesis.
%\haveObjectstrue%       Uncomment this if you have Objects in your thesis. This is almost certainly not the case however.

%%% Below are the commands to set the degree type, department, graduation time, and chair. 
%       Most of these are self explanatory. 
%       Note: The \chair command takes an optional argument for a cochair. 
%           So if John was your chair and Jacob was a cochair, you would use \chair[Jacob]{John}.
%           If John was your chair and you had no cochair, you can simply use \chair{John}.
