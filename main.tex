%=== NOTES TO FUTURE USERS ===%
% First off, hello and welcome to your very own thesis tutorial!
% * Inside ufdissertation.cls you'll find this custom environment command:
% \begin{multiFigure}
%     \centering
%     \addFigure{0.48}{path/to/fig1}  % <== If just using 1 fig, then use \includegraphics[]{}
%     \addFigure{0.48}{path/to/fig2}
%     \captionof{figure}  % <== This can be either {figure} or {table}.
%         [This short caption appears in the List of Figures]  % <== Don't use a period!
%         {This long caption should explain the figure/table in more detail.
%         \;A) First figure details...
%         \;B) Second figure details...}
%     \label{fig:two_figures}
% \end{multiFigure}
% TODO: Suzanne may have fixed the weird centering problem! Delete the below if so.
% Make sure that there is text DIRECTLY ABOVE \begin{multiFigure} (i.e., NO NEWLINE above)---otherwise your figs will be off-center!
% * I finally realize why this happens: if there is a newline above multiFigure, then LaTeX treats this as the start of a new paragraph. So it INDENTS the multifigure (which spans all of \textwidth, which is indented!).
% * Sprinkle the word "TODO" around your document when you need to fix something later.

%=== Rules on CAPITALIZATION ===%
% Title Case: all principal words are capitalized except prepositions, articles, and conjunctions.
% Sentence Case: Normal sentence rules.

% Ch. 1: CHAPTER TITLES ARE ALL CAPS
% Sec. 1.2: Section Titles Are in Title Case
% Subsec. 1.2.3: Subsection Titles Are in Title Case
% Subsubsec. 1.2.3.4: Subsubsection titles are in sentence case
% Any header levels beyond subsubsections should just use bold text and should not be numbered.

% \usepackage[compat=1.1.0]{tikz-feynman}% for drawing feynman diagrams 
\usepackage[compat=1.0.0]{tikz-feynman}% for drawing feynman diagrams 
\usepackage{pgfplots}%   pgfplots is tikz but better.

\usepackage{xcolor}
\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption} % allowing to use subfigure inside figure
\usepackage{topcapt} % allow \topcaption
\usepackage{graphicx} % allow \resizebox
\usepackage{newtxtext}

% A lovely package that lets you use \cref{} that handles the words: Figure, Fig., Figures, Figs., Table, Tables, etc.!
\usepackage[capitalise]{cleveref}
\Crefname{chapter}{Ch.}{Chs.}
\Crefname{section}{Sec.}{Secs.}
\Crefname{equation}{Eqn.}{Eqns.}
\Crefname{figure}{Fig.}{Figs.}
% How to use \cref:
% * "\Cref{fig1,fig2,fig3} show..."        produces: "Figures 1-5 to 1-7 show..."
% * "As shown in \cref{fig1,fig2,fig3}..." produces: "As shown in Figs. 1-5 to 1-7..." (notice the lowercase \cref!)
% Also works for Tables:
% * "\Cref{tab1,tab2,tab3} show..."        produces: "Tables 1-5 to 1-7 show..."
% * "As shown in \cref{tab1,tab2,tab3}..." produces: "As shown in Tables 1-5 to 1-7..." (assuming that table objects are referenced).
%=== Keep in mind that there should be no white spaces between labels!
% You can use \Crefrange{fig1}{fig4} instead, but it doesn't produce as precise results:
% * "\Cref{fig1,fig2,fig3,fig5,fig6} show..." produces: "Figures 1-5 to 1-7, 1-9 and 1-10 show...". You can't do this with \Crefrange or \crefrange.
% \crefrange also always uses the word "to"---never the word "and" (for when you use just 2 figs/tables). 

\usepackage[greek,english]{babel}
\setlength\cellspacetoplimit{10pt}
\setlength\cellspacebottomlimit{10pt}

%=== Suz's packages for tables.
% \usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
% \usepackage{times}
% \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % seems it is by default and not needed
\usepackage{booktabs}
\newcolumntype{Y}{>{\centering\arraybackslash}X}
\newcolumntype{B}{>{\hsize=.15\hsize}Y}
\newcolumntype{M}{>{\hsize=.25\hsize}Y}
\newcolumntype{S}{>{\hsize=.05\hsize}Y}

%===For Suzanne's Feynman diagrams.
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{patterns}
\pgfdeclarepatternformonly{south west lines}{\pgfqpoint{-0pt}{-0pt}}{\pgfqpoint{3pt}{3pt}}{\pgfqpoint{3pt}{3pt}}{
    \pgfsetlinewidth{0.4pt}
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfqpoint{0pt}{0pt}}
    \pgfpathlineto{\pgfqpoint{3pt}{3pt}}
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfqpoint{2.8pt}{-.2pt}}
    \pgfpathlineto{\pgfqpoint{3.2pt}{.2pt}}
    \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfqpoint{-.2pt}{2.8pt}}
    \pgfpathlineto{\pgfqpoint{.2pt}{3.2pt}}
    \pgfusepath{stroke}
}

%=== N.B.: If you want to use biblatex, go into ufdissertation.cls and search for 'biblatex' (un)comment instructions.
% \usepackage[sorting=none, backend=biber, style=phys, biblabel=brackets]{biblatex}
% \usepackage[sorting=none]{biblatex}
% \addbibresource{biblatex-phys.bib}  % If using biblatex: uncomment this.

% Enable format for table, figure, object
\haveTablestrue%        Uncomment this if you have tables in your thesis.
\haveFigurestrue%       Uncomment this if you have figures in your thesis.
%\haveObjectstrue%       Uncomment this if you have Objects in your thesis. This is almost certainly not the case however.

%%% Below are the commands to set the degree type, department, graduation time, and chair. 
%       Most of these are self explanatory. 
%       Note: The \chair command takes an optional argument for a cochair. 
%           So if John was your chair and Jacob was a cochair, you would use \chair[Jacob]{John}.
%           If John was your chair and you had no cochair, you can simply use \chair{John}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Author info
\title{Precision Measurement of the Higgs Boson Mass and Search for Dilepton Mass Resonances in $\htofourl$ Decays Using the CMS Detector at the LHC}
\degreeType{Doctor of Philosophy}         % Official name of your degree; eg "Doctorate of Philosophy".
\major{Physics}                              % Your official Department.
\author{Jake Rosenzweig}%                  Your Name
\thesisType{Dissertation}%              Dissertation (PhD) or Thesis (Masters)
\degreeYear{2022}%                      Intended graduation year (not the year you submit the thesis)
\degreeMonth{December}%                   Month of graduation should be May, August, or December.
\chair[Guenakh Mitselmakher]{Andrey Korytov}%                   Chair and Cochair (see comment block above).

%% additional sections
% \setDedicationFile{tex/dedicationFile}%                Dedication Page
\setAcknowledgementsFile{tex/acknowledgementsFile}%    Acknowledgements Page
% \setBiographicalFile{tex/biographyFile}%               Biography file of the Author (you).
% \setAbstractFile{tex/abstractFile}%                    Abstract Page (This should only include the abstract itself)

%=== Bibliography is printed in the command \setReferenceFile below. ===%
% \bibliographystyle{plain}
% \bibliography{referenceFile}
\setReferenceFile{referenceFile}{jhep}%        References. First argument is your bibtex source file (.bib) the second argument is your bibtex style file (.bst).
% \setReferenceFile{referenceFile}{amsplain}
% Use the style "unsrtnat" since it sorts references in cite order and shows url.
% Other bibliographystyles: unsrtnat, apsrev, ieeetr, jhep (beautiful but doesn't show url).

%%%% These are NOT required, so only use them if you actually need/have them.
% \setAbbreviationsFile{tex/abbreviations}%           Abbreviations Page. Jake changed this to say "LIST OF ACRONYMS".
\setAppendixFile{tex/appendix}%                     Appendix Content; hyperlinking might be weird. TODO: Fix hyperlinking.
\multipleAppendixtrue%                          Uncomment this if you have more than one appendix, otherwise leave it commented. This adds "A", "B" in the TOC next to each Appendix entry.
