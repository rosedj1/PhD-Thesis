%=== BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN LATEX with the UF template ===%
% There are 2 main bib organizers in LaTeX: BibTeX and BibLaTeX (and no, they're not the same thing!).
% * BibTeX comes standard with the UF template but offers limited flexibility.
% * BibLaTeX offers excellent flexibility, but you'll need to go into ufdissertation.cls and perform the 'biblatex' (un)comment instructions as well as changing some things in main.tex.
% default biblatex style: It uses the word "In: " in strange places. Otherwise it looks good. What journal would it correspond to though?

%=== How to get your bib to look the way you want (BibTeX). ===%
% (1) Select a journal style you like: JHEP, APS, MLA, Chicago, etc.
%     Use paperpile.com to look at citation styles---it seems good but look at an example paper from that journal to confirm the citation style.
%     E.g., https://paperpile.com/s/physical-review-d-citation-style/
% (2) Download the corresponding '.bst' (bibliography style) file.
% (3) Put the '.bst' file in your working area.
% E.g., JHEP bst file: https://jhep.sissa.it/jhep/help/JHEP/TeXclass/DOCS/JHEP.bst

%=== ...And now I find this note from the original UF LaTeX template... ===%
% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %
% Remember - You MUST get a .bst file that matches the Journal in your
% field that you choose as your Reference example
% NONE of these examples will satisfy the Graduate Editorial Office
% if they don't match your Journal example!!!!
% NOTE: If you use a numbered reference system and your references
% are set in parentheses rather than brackets you need to select the
% Natbib option "numbers sort and compress" in the packages.tex file
% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

%=== Notes on different styles: ===%
% JHEP: I will use this style! Reference titles are italicized, sentence case (i.e., only the first word's first letter is uppercase), proper nouns are also uppercase, references are in appearance-order, citation ranges look like 1--3. 
% Physical Letters B looks really good, except that it doesn't often include titles of refs!
% Physical REVIEW Letters uses italicized titles.
% Nature: Bibliography labels are like: 1., 2., instead of [1], [2], ..
% Science: Uses italic numbers.
% MLA: In the text, uses name the reference instead of number.
% Chicago: Uses the date in the text and doesn't use any numbers in the bib.
% Chem-ACS: Doesn't include the title! Also, uses parentheses around numbers in bib.

%=== After spending loads of time on bibliography styles, etc., I've learned: ===%
% * Don't export bibliography from zotero---instead pull citation from website, then make the following changes:
% (1) Delete key=abstract, if it exists.
% (2) If 3 or more authors, only keep the first author and replace second onward with "and others" (this will be replaced by "et al.").
% (3) Make sure that key=url is filled out.

% DOI = Digital Object Identifier. A unique and never-changing string assigned to online (journal) articles, books, and other works.

CMS recommendations:
References should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they are cited in the text.
The general guidelines for choosing references are:
* Reference all papers that were useful in preparing and making the specific measurement.
* Reference previous measurements extensively (in particular from other LHC and Tevatron experiments).
* Reference relevant theoretical papers, especially ones that predict a value for your measurement.
* Give a minimal general bibliography for the nonexpert reader who might need to be educated on the subject. These are papers typically referred to in the introduction.

% N.B.: Curly braces:

% * Allow you to use commands, e.g., ...mass near 125{\GeV}
% * I don't think are required to use math env ($...$)
% * I think if you do: "{...}", then letter case is protected (so you don't have to do: {The {H}iggs boson...}).

% Xunwu's changes to the original citation taken from url:
% * Added key=number and made the value=(reportNumber's value).
% * In number's value, changed comma to dot to separate strings.
% * Removed ", CMS-TDR-12" from reportNumber.
% This techreport printout looks like this:
% <author>, <title>, Technical Report <number>, <month> <year>. <url>

% TODO: In key=title, get the sqrt symbol to have math mode font. 
% TODO: Change all lepton l's to {$\ell$}
% TODO: Are quotes around titles necessary?

%=== FINAL DECISION: I will use JHEP citation style. ===%
% Reference titles are italicized, sentence case (i.e., only the first word's first letter is uppercase), proper nouns are also uppercase, references are in appearance-order, citation ranges look like 1--3 (and use an en dash). 
% So if this is in the title: "pp collisions at sqrt{s} = 7 TeV", everything EXCEPT the 7 is italicized. The "=" is in math mode.
% Interestingly, JHEP uses lowercase "ref.", "refs.", "section", "figure", "figures", "table", "tables 12--14". Doesn't use "fig.", "sec.", or "tab.".
% The reference label (e.g., [2]) can be put directly after the thing which it references or at the end of the sentence.
% Introduce abbreviations in parentheses: "The standard model (SM)...the SM Higgs boson (H)."
% Lowercase 'c' when saying 'CMS collaboration'.
% When to use 'et al.'? I can't say for sure in JHEP style... I've seen:
% * 'M. Della Negra et al., Muon trigger...'
% * 'CDF Collaboration, D0 collaboration, T. Aaltonen et al., Combination of...'
% * 'M. Anfreville, D. Bailleux, J. Bard, A. Bornheim, C. Bouchand et al., Laser monitoring...'

The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W+W−, τ+τ−, and bb¯. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.},

Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.},

We focus on the properties of the test procedures that allow one to account for systematic uncertainties. Explicit formulae for the asymptotic distributions of test statistics are derived using results of Wilks and Wald. We motivate and justify the use of a representative data set, called the “Asimov data set”, which provides a simple method to obtain the median experimental sensitivity of a search or measurement as well as ﬂuctuations about this expectation.},

The W+W− candidates are selected in events with an oppositely charged lepton pair, large missing transverse momentum, and various numbers of jets. To select Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion and associated production with a W or Z boson, events with two jets or three or four leptons are also selected. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1, collected in pp collisions at s=13TeV by the CMS detector at the LHC during 2016. Combining all channels, the observed cross section times branching fraction is 1.28−0.17+0.18 times the standard model prediction for the Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09GeV. This is the first observation of the Higgs boson decay to W boson pairs by the CMS experiment.}

The H→ττ signal is established with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations, to be compared to an expected significance of 4.7 standard deviations. The best fit of the product of the observed H→ττ signal production cross section and branching fraction is 1.09−0.26+0.27 times the standard model expectation.

abstract = "A search is presented for a standard model-like Higgs boson decaying to the μ+μ− or e+e− final states based on proton–proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.0 fb−1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 19.7 fb−1 at 8 TeV for the μ+μ− search, and of 19.7 fb−1 at 8 TeV for the e+e− search. Upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction at the 95% confidence level are reported for Higgs boson masses in the range from 120 to 150 GeV. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV decaying to μ+μ−, the observed (expected) upper limit on the production rate is found to be 7.4 (6.5−1.9+2.8) times the standard model value. This corresponds to an upper limit on the branching fraction of 0.0016. Similarly, for e+e−, an upper limit of 0.0019 is placed on the branching fraction, which is ≈3.7×105 times the standard model value. These results, together with recent evidence of the 125 GeV boson coupling to τ-leptons with a larger branching fraction consistent with the standard model, confirm that the leptonic couplings of the new boson are not flavour-universal."

It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics."

It also has a set of utilities and several interfaces to external programs.

Computer: Commodity PCs, Macs. Operating system: Linux, OS X; should also work on other systems. RAM: ∼10 megabytes Classification: 11.2. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: ACTU_v3_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 178 (2008) 852 Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models. Summary of revisions: Hundreds of new features and bug fixes, allowing improved modelling. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10–1000 events per second, depending on process studied."

	abstract = {I show that with simple extensions of the shower algorithms in Monte Carlo programs, one can implement NLO corrections to the hardest emission that overcome the problems of negative weighted events found in previous implementations. Simple variants of the same method can be used for an improved treatment of matrix element corrections in Shower Monte Carlo programs.}

	abstract = {The aim of this work is to describe in detail the POWHEG method, first suggested by one of the authors, for interfacing parton-shower generators with NLO QCD computations. We describe the method in its full generality, and then specify its features in two subtraction frameworks for NLO calculations: the Catani-Seymour and the Frixione-Kunszt-Signer approach. Two examples are discussed in detail in both approaches: the production of hadrons in e+e− collisions, and the Drell-Yan vector-boson production in hadronic collisions.}
