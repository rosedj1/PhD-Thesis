%=== BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN LATEX with the UF template ===%
% There are 2 main bib organizers in LaTeX: BibTeX and BibLaTeX (and no, they're not the same thing!).
% * BibTeX comes standard with the UF template but offers limited flexibility.
% * BibLaTeX offers excellent flexibility, but you'll need to go into ufdissertation.cls and perform the 'biblatex' (un)comment instructions as well as changing some things in main.tex.
% default biblatex style: It uses the word "In: " in strange places. Otherwise it looks good. What journal would it correspond to though?

%=== How to get your bib to look the way you want (BibTeX). ===%
% (1) Select a journal style you like: JHEP, APS, MLA, Chicago, etc.
% (2) Download the corresponding '.bst' (bibliography style) file.
% (3) Put the '.bst' file in your working area.
% E.g., JHEP bst file: https://jhep.sissa.it/jhep/help/JHEP/TeXclass/DOCS/JHEP.bst

%=== Thoughts on different styles: ===%
% JHEP: Reference titles are italicized, references in appearance-order, citation ranges look like 1--3. Bibtex has difficulty getting references unsorted (i.e., in appearance-order).
% Physical Letters B looks really good, except that it doesn't often include titles of refs!
% Physical REVIEW Letters uses italicized titles.
% Nature: Bibliography labels are like: 1., 2., instead of [1], [2], ..
% Science: Uses italic numbers.
% MLA: In the text, uses name the reference instead of number.
% Chicago: Uses the date in the text and doesn't use any numbers in the bib.
% Chem-ACS: Doesn't include the title! Also, uses parentheses around numbers in bib.

%=== After spending loads of time on bibliography styles, etc., I've learned: ===%
% * Don't export bibliography from zotero---instead pull citation from website, then make the following changes:
% (1) Delete key=abstract, if it exists.
% (2) If 3 or more authors, only keep the first author and replace second onward with "and others" (this will be replaced by "et al.").
% (3) Make sure that key=url is filled out.

% TODO: Are quotes around titles necessary?
% DOI = Digital Object Identifier. A unique and never-changing string assigned to online (journal) articles, books, and other works.

CMS recommendations:
References should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they are cited in the text.
The general guidelines for choosing references are:
* Reference all papers that were useful in preparing and making the specific measurement.
* Reference previous measurements extensively (in particular from other LHC and Tevatron experiments).
* Reference relevant theoretical papers, especially ones that predict a value for your measurement.
* Give a minimal general bibliography for the nonexpert reader who might need to be educated on the subject. These are papers typically referred to in the introduction.

The search is performed in five decay modes: $\gamma$$\gamma$, ZZ, W+W-, $\tau$+$\tau$-, and bb{\textasciimacron}. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, $\gamma$$\gamma$ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3{\textpm}0.4(stat.){\textpm}0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.},

Individual searches in the channels H{\textrightarrow}ZZ(?){\textrightarrow}4l, H{\textrightarrow}$\gamma$$\gamma$ and H{\textrightarrow}WW(?){\textrightarrow}e$\nu$$\mu$$\nu$ in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H{\textrightarrow}ZZ(?), WW(?), bb{\textasciimacron} and $\tau$+$\tau$- in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H{\textrightarrow}ZZ(?){\textrightarrow}4l and H{\textrightarrow}$\gamma$$\gamma$ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0{\textpm}0.4(stat){\textpm}0.4(sys)~GeV is presented.

	abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.},

      abstract = {The mass of the W boson, a mediator of the weak force between elementary particles, is tightly constrained by the symmetries of the standard model of particle physics. The Higgs boson was the last missing component of the model. After observation of the Higgs boson, a measurement of the W boson mass provides a stringent test of the model. We measure the W boson mass, MW, using data corresponding to 8.8 inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity collected in proton-antiproton collisions at a 1.96 tera–electron volt center-of-mass energy with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. A sample of approximately 4 million W boson candidates is used to obtain MW=80,433.5±6.4stat±6.9syst=80,433.5±9.4\&nbsp;MeV/c2, the precision of which exceeds that of all previous measurements combined (stat, statistical uncertainty; syst, systematic uncertainty; MeV, mega–electron volts; c, speed of light in a vacuum). This measurement is in significant tension with the standard model expectation. W bosons mediate the weak interaction, one of the fundamental forces in physics. Because the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics places tight constraints on the mass of the W boson, measuring the mass puts the SM to the test. The Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) Collaboration now reports a precise measurement of the W boson mass extracted from data taken at the Tevatron particle accelerator (see the Perspective by Campagnari and Mulders). Surprisingly, the researchers found that the mass of the boson was significantly higher than the SM predicts, with a discrepancy of 7 standard deviations. —JS Analysis of the data collected at the Tevatron particle collider finds that the W boson is heavier than expected.}

The W+W− candidates are selected in events with an oppositely charged lepton pair, large missing transverse momentum, and various numbers of jets. To select Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion and associated production with a W or Z boson, events with two jets or three or four leptons are also selected. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1, collected in pp collisions at s=13TeV by the CMS detector at the LHC during 2016. Combining all channels, the observed cross section times branching fraction is 1.28−0.17+0.18 times the standard model prediction for the Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09GeV. This is the first observation of the Higgs boson decay to W boson pairs by the CMS experiment.}

The H→ττ signal is established with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations, to be compared to an expected significance of 4.7 standard deviations. The best fit of the product of the observed H→ττ signal production cross section and branching fraction is 1.09−0.26+0.27 times the standard model expectation. The combination with the corresponding measurement performed with data collected by the CMS experiment at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8TeV leads to an observed significance of 5.9 standard deviations, equal to the expected significance.

The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.0 fb−1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 19.7 fb−1 at 8 TeV for the μ+μ− search, and of 19.7 fb−1 at 8 TeV for the e+e− search. Upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction at the 95% confidence level are reported for Higgs boson masses in the range from 120 to 150 GeV. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV decaying to μ+μ−, the observed (expected) upper limit on the production rate is found to be 7.4 (6.5−1.9+2.8) times the standard model value. This corresponds to an upper limit on the branching fraction of 0.0016. Similarly, for e+e−, an upper limit of 0.0019 is placed on the branching fraction, which is ≈3.7×105 times the standard model value. These results, together with recent evidence of the 125 GeV boson coupling to τ-leptons with a larger branching fraction consistent with the standard model, confirm that the leptonic couplings of the new boson are not flavour-universal."

abstract = "Geant4 is a toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through matter. It includes a complete range of functionality including tracking, geometry, physics models and hits. The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics."

abstract = "The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of events in high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multiparticle final state. It contains a library of hard processes, models for initial- and final-state parton showers, matching and merging methods between hard processes and parton showers, multiparton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and several interfaces to external programs. Pythia 8.2 is the second main release after the complete rewrite from Fortran to C++, and now has reached such a maturity that it offers a complete replacement for most applications, notably for LHC physics studies. The many new features should allow an improved description of data.

Program title: Pythia 8.2 Catalogue identifier: ACTU_v4_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ACTU_v4_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public Licence, version 2 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 478360 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 14131810 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++. Computer: Commodity PCs, Macs. Operating system: Linux, OS X; should also work on other systems. RAM: ∼10 megabytes Classification: 11.2. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: ACTU_v3_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 178 (2008) 852 Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models. Summary of revisions: Hundreds of new features and bug fixes, allowing improved modelling. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10–1000 events per second, depending on process studied."
