\chapter{Introduction}

The universe has particles.
The interactions between these particles are described very well by the Standard Model (SM).
However, the SM doesn't predict the masses of particles.
In 1964, the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism proposed that breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry of the vacuum would give rise to non-zero masses of the weak gauge bosons.
This would yield a secondary effect too:
there should exist a fundamental scalar boson which is the quantum of the so-called ``Higgs field''.
On July 4th, 2012, this Higgs boson was discovered.


At first glance, the universe appears to be an overwhelmingly vast and complicated place.
However upon closer inspection, it is comprised of only a few different kinds of fundamental particles.
Particle physics has given rise to the Standard Model (SM) which mathematically describes these constituents and their interactions with each other.




The Standard Model (SM) is an impressively accurate mathematical theory which describes the fundamental particles of the universe and the rules for their possible interactions.
Problematically though, the SM predicts that all particles are massless.


Get to the Higgs boson.

Why is it important?
Knowing the mass of the Higgs boson
