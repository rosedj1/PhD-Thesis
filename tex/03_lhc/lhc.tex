\chapter{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{ch:lhc}

Located on the border between France and Switzerland, sandwiched between the beautiful Jura mountains to the west and the sprawling city of Geneva (Genève) to the east, is CERN:
the European Organization for Nuclear Research 
(Conseil Européean pour la Recherche Nucléaire).
CERN is an international collaboration of more than 23 member states and its ``family'' is steadily growing.
This collaboration is responsible for the construction and commissioning of the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator:
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

The LHC collides particles using the brightest beams and highest energies that humans have ever made.
Bright beams meaning highest luminosity.

Higgs boson produced every 1 billion collisions.

Beginning in 2026 (FIXME), the LHC will undergo a ``Phase 2'' upgrade and become the High-Luminosity LHC.
This upgrade will increase the collider's luminosity by 10 fold (FIXME) and is predicted to deliver SO much data 3000 fb?.
