Weighing in at 14\,000 tonnes, standing 15 meters (5 stories) tall, and reaching 29 meters long, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment (Fig.~\ref{fig:cms_poster}) is one of 
% two general-purpose particle detectors at the LHC (Fig.~\ref{fig:cms_poster}).
the four major particle detectors at the LHC.
CMS is situated approximately 100\meter under the earth at the fifth collision point (\emph{Point 5}) along the LHC, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lhc_points}.
In the summer of 2012, both CMS and its competing experiment, A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS), independently discovered the Higgs boson~\cite{chatrchyan_observation_2012, aad_observation_2012, chatrchyan_observation_2013}, a triumphant day that was recorded in particle physics history.

% The purpose of CMS is to precisely measure the kinematical properties of the abundant decay products that come from the \pp collisions delivered by the LHC.
% These particle properties, like momentum, energy, and charge, are used to reconstruct the particle trajectories (``tracks'') and help to identify the particles themselves.

The LHC (Ch.~\ref{ch:lhc}) directs two proton bunches together on a collision course every 25\ns to produce thousands of new particles per \pp collision.
These outward-moving particles travel all sorts of directions away from the interaction point.
CMS is built around the interaction point in a series of cylindrical subdetectors for nearly hermetic coverage so that most of the particles \emph{must} travel through CMS.
The detector sports a solenoid---for which CMS was named---which generates a 3.8\tesla uniform magnetic field that points longitudinally down the central axis of CMS.
This strong magnetic field applies a Lorentz force on the outgoing charged particles, causing them to follow helical, momentum-dependent trajectories.
These curved tracks separate from one another which assists in particle identification.
Electrically neutral particles experience no Lorentz force and thus travel in straight lines.

The subdetectors shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cms_cut_out_view} measure the momenta and energies of the particles emitted from the \pp collision point.
As particles interact with the subdetectors, they may pass through some while getting completely absorbed by others.
For example, charged particles can leave `hits' in the silicon tracker system and continue through to the next radially outward subdetector, whereas hadronic matter tends to be captured by the hadronic calorimeter.
In this way, CMS is like a large `particle filter'.

Generally, hits can be reconstructed into particle tracks.
From the track curvature, the charge and momentum of the particles can be deduced.
Depending on \emph{which} subdetector (or combination of subdetectors) produced signals, the type of particle can be deduced.
A few example particles and their associated tracks are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cms_particle_trajectories}.

Before discussing each subdetector in the following sections, it is useful to define the coordinate system used in CMS;
a typical, right-handed, three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system $(x, y, z)$ is chosen, whose center $(0, 0, 0)$ is placed at the nominal \pp collision point within CMS.
The $x$ axis points towards the center of the LHC, the $y$ axis points vertically upward, and the $z$ axis points westward towards the Jura mountains, tangential to the beam direction.
Since CMS covers almost the entire spherical $4\pi$ steradians around the interaction point, it is convenient to use spherical coordinates $(r, \phi, \theta)$,
in which $r$ measures the radial distance in the $x$-$y$ plane, $\phi$ measures the azimuthal angle in the $x$-$y$ plane as measured from the $x$ axis, and $\theta$ measures the polar angle as measured from the $z$ axis.
When dealing with ultra-relativistic particles like those produced at the LHC, special-relativistic effects like length contraction must be taken into account and so the coordinate $\theta$ becomes frame-dependent.
It is thus helpful to convert $\theta$ to the Lorentz-invariant quantity called pseudorapidity $(\eta)$,
defined as $\eta = -\ln [ \tan(\theta/2)]$. % Formula comes from: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Sandbox/GeorgeAlversonSandbox#Symbols_and_units_natural_units

In the remainder of this chapter, the subdetectors of CMS are described in detail:
the silicon tracker in Sec.~\ref{sec:tracker},
followed by the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters in Sec.~\ref{sec:calo},
then the solenoid and yoke system in Sec.~\ref{sec:solenoid}.

        A positron (solid red line) curves due to the presence of the magnetic field and gets stopped in the ECAL, creating an EM shower.
        A photon (blue dashed line) does not get detected at all by the Silicon Tracker, since it has no electric charge.
        It continues through to the ECAL and makes a shower here, like the positron.
        Charged hadrons (solid green line) will show curved tracks from the Silicon Tracker, may leave some trace in the ECAL, but primarily get stopped by the HCAL creating hadronic showers.
        Neutral hadrons (dashed green line) do not interact with the tracker, and only undergo EM showers a little in the ECAL, but show most energy deposits in the HCAL.
        Muons (solid blue line) are detected by the Silicon Tracker and then mostly pass through the other subdetectors without interacting until they finally reach the Muon System.
        Using the Lorentz force law and knowing which direction the magnetic field is pointing, one can deduce the sign of the charge of the particle. 
        Based on the radius of curvature from the trajectory, one can then calculate the momentum and energy of the particle.
