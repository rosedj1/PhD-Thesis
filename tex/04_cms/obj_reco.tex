\section{Object Reconstruction}
\label{sec:obj_reco}
A single \pp collision yields thousands of particles, each of which must be identified by the CMS detector in order to be used in physics analyses.
The primary software for object identification within CMS is called Particle Flow. % TODO: special font for Particle Flow? % TODO: ref
% The \pp collision itself is called the \emph{primary vertex} and must be carefully reconstructed (Sec.~\ref{sec:track_vertex_reco}).
Electron and photon objects are reconstructed (Sec.~\ref{sec:egamma_reco}) using the silicon tracker (Sec.~\ref{sec:tracker}) and ECAL (Sec.~\ref{sec:ecal}) systems.
The reconstruction of muon objects (Sec.~\ref{sec:muon_reco}) uses information from all subdetectors, the most important of which are the silicon tracker and muon system (Sec.~\ref{sec:muon_sys}).
Tau objects are the final type of charged leptons to be reconstructed (Sec.~\ref{sec:tau_reco}), which may decay hadronically---thus leaving hadronic energy signatures in the HCAL---and by the silicon tracker detecting a displaced secondary vertex, thanks to the relatively long lifetime of the tau lepton.  % TODO: Bleh. I don't like this sentence. Ref.    displaced secondary vertex coupled with ECAL .
Hadronic matter is grouped into jet objects, each of which is carefully reconstructed (Sec.~\ref{sec:jet_reco}.) using information from the silicon tracker, ECAL, and HCAL (Sec.~\ref{sec:hcal}).
Finally, after accounting for all the momenta and energies of the observed particles, the missing transverse energy $\left( \MET \right)$ is evaluated (Sec.~\ref{sec:met_reco}).

\subsection{Electron and Photon Reconstruction}
\label{sec:egamma_reco}
Electrons and photons both leave energy deposits within the crystals of the ECAL---so how are the two kinds of particles differentiated from one another?
Since photons are electrically neutral, the silion tracker will not detect them.
Another consequence of their neutrality is that photons do not bend in a magnetic field;
their energy deposits will point radially back to the vertex from which they originated.
On the other hand, electrons \emph{are} charged and so will not onlyÂ be detected within the layers of the silicon tracker but will also reveal a curved track.
Hence, the energy deposits from electrons within the ECAL will not necessarily point towards the vertex from which the electron came~\cite{Ereco_performance_2015}.

Within CMS, track fitting and pattern recognition typically occur within a single framework called the Combinatorial Track Finder (CTF), which is an extension of the Kalman filter~\cite{general_track_reco}.
However, the reconstruction of tracks of charged particles is computationally difficult  the CTF 
As electrons pass through matter, they may radiate away some of their energy in the form of bremsstrahlung photons.
The distribution of this energy loss is extremely non-Gaussian and is not accurately modeled by the Kalman Filter.
Instead, the CMS tracker uses a Gaussian-sum filter (GSF) algorithm~\cite{gsf} to model the energy-loss distribution as a mixture of Gaussian functions.
This ultimately improves the momentum resolution of electrons.

\subsection{Muon Reconstruction}
\label{sec:muon_reco}

Muons leave a very clean signature in the CMS detector thanks to their interactions in the muon spectrometers. Consequently, muon tracks are reconstructed by dedicated algorithms that are independent from the iterative PF identification system used to reconstruct other particles. These algorithms are based on a Kalman filter method that accounts for the muon energy loss in the detector materials.

The most reliable muon detection occurs when both the silicon tracker \emph{and} the muon system both register hits corresponding to the same particle object.
When both subsystems detect such a particle---most likely a muon---it is called a \emph{global muon}.
This can be compared to the situation when only the muon system registers hits, in which case this is most likely a \emph{standalone muon} and must be rejected due to its worse momentum resolution and higher contamination from cosmic ray background.
The opposite case occurs when only the tracker registers hits and the corresponding particle is termed a \emph{tracker muon}~\cite{reco_muon}.

The tracker and muon systems exhibit high reconstruction efficiency, and about 99\% of muons are reconstructed either as tracker or global muons, and candidates sharing the same inner tracks are merged into a single object. Muon charge and momentum assignments are calculated from tracker measurements for muons with $p_T < 200 \;\text{GeV}$, since multiple scattering effects may degrade the muon detector measurements. The global track curvature is instead used for muons with $p_T > 200 \;\text{GeV}$ if the charge-to-momentum ratio agrees within two standard deviations from the tracker-only measurement. The muon transverse momentum resolution thus ranges from 1 to 6\% depending on the $\eta$ coordinate for muons with $p_T < 100 \;\text{GeV}$, which is better than the 10\% resolution for central muons of $p_T = 1 \;\text{TeV}$.

\subsection{Tau Reconstruction}
\label{sec:tau_reco}

Tau leptons are characterized by a mean lifetime of about $2.9\times10^{-13}\;\text{s}$, meaning they decay within a few millimeters from their production point for the typical Lorentz boosts at the LHC. Fully leptonic decays are reconstructed in a similar way as other leptons, semileptonic decays to hardrons and a neutrino result in small and collimated hadron jetss requiring a specific reconstruction algorithm.
