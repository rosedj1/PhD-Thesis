\section{The Solenoid and the Steel Return Yoke}
\label{sec:solenoid}

The Compact Muon \emph{Solenoid} sports one of the world's most energetic solenoids which is paramount to the success of CMS.
Particles that exit the HCAL (Sec.~\ref{sec:hcal}) arrive at the cylindrical magnet which is 12.5\meter in length, has a bore diameter of 6\meter (6.3\meter when cold), and generates a uniform 3.8\tesla magnetic field parallel to the beam line.
To produce such a large and uniform magnetic field inside the approximately 360$\meter^3$ volume (Fig.~\ref{fig:cms_magnetic_field}), an 18\,000 amp current travels through the 4-layer, superconducting, NbTi coils.
This magnetic field stores a massive 2.6\GJ of energy---approximately the kinetic energy of an Airbus A320 in flight---and is 100\,000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field, as measured on the surface.
The magnet has such a large stored-energy-to-cold-mass ratio (11.6\KJ/\Kgns) that it experiences a physical deformation of 0.15\% while being energized.

As charged particles travel through any magnetic field, they experience a magnetic (Lorentz) force perpendicular to their direction of travel.
The Lorentz force $\left( \vec{F}_B \right)$ exerted on a particle with charge $q$ depends on the particle's velocity $\left( \vec{v} \right)$ and the magnetic field $\left( \vec{B} \right)$ via the cross product
\begin{equation*}
    \vec{F}_B = q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}.
\end{equation*}
Since the force is necessarily perpendicular to the velocity, the resulting trajectory is helical.
Projecting the helix on the $x$-$y$ plane (since the magnetic field points in the $+z$ direction) allows the particle tracks to typically be separated from one another.
Each track has a corresponding radius of curvature $\left( R \right)$ which relates to its transverse momentum $\left( \pt \right)$ through
\begin{equation*}
    \pt = qBR.
\end{equation*}
The relative change in \pt (\ie the \emph{momentum resolution}) is given by
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\delta \pt}{\pt} \propto \frac{\pt}{BL^2}.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Steel Return Yoke:} 
Most of the mass of CMS comes from the \emph{steel return yoke} which helps to redirect the magnetic field back on itself. 
The yoke system constitutes 10\,000 tonnes, which is 89\% of the total mass of CMS.
It is comprised of 5 wheels and 2 endcaps.
