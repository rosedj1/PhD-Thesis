\subsection{The Level-1 Trigger}
\label{sec:L1_trig}

Trigger system helps to manage the enormous collision rate at 
Size of 1 event is about 3 MB.
This would be TB of data per second, which isn't feasible.
Two stages of a trigger system: Level 1 Trigger (L1) and the High Level Trigger (HLT).

L1 Trigger has about a trigger rate of 100 KHz as a hard limit.
It's latency is only 3.2 microsec.

At the start of a fill in the LHC, the trigger rate is maximum.
INSERT L1 trigger rate plot.

In order to remain at the maximal L1 trigger, prescales are implemented which switch on new triggers, while turning off others.
Collision data which passes certain triggers can be ``parked'' on disk and analyzed later (FIXME e.g., during Long Shutdowns)  Data parking is used to 
Data scouting: 
The HLT has a trigger rate of about 1.5 KHz.
It can write out about 5 GB/s to disk and has a much higher latency of 0.5 s compared to the L1 Trigger.

\subsection{The High-Level Trigger}
\label{sec:hlt}

Only record 1K events/s some events only occur only once per 10B collisions!
