\chapter{Higgs Boson Mass Measurement in the \hzzfourl Channel}\label{ch:higgs_mass}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:higgs_intro}

At the LHC, the Higgs boson is produced in only 1 out of every billion pp collisions.
Furthermore, the Higgs boson has a mean lifetime of only 1E-23 s,
so the boson itself will never live long enough to interact directly with the CMS Detector.
Therefore, the Higgs boson can only be detected by the daughter particles into which it decays.
