\chapter{Higgs Boson Mass Measurement in the \texorpdfstring{\hzzfourl}{H to ZZ to 4l} Channel}
% Need to use \textorpdfstring{} so it also shows in pdf bookmarks.
\section{Introduction}
- Higgs discovery:
    - EACH OF THESE IS A SENTENCE
    - higgs discovered in 2012 by CMS, ATLAS.
    - This was a momentous discovery and often called the ``missing puzzle piece'' of the SM.
    - So far it is one of a kind: fundamental scalar particle.
    - To be certain it is the predicted Higgs boson from the SM, it is necessary to measure its properties and compare them to the predictions of the SM.

- Higgs properties:
    - Portal to BSM (ref: search for dilepton mass resonance)
    - There are many results on Higgs properties: spin, charge, decay processes, lifetime, mass.
    - The last of these is of particular importance: depending on mH and mtop, the stability of the Universe.

- ALL previous mass measurements:
    - Run 1:
        - H->2gamma VALUE
        - H->ZZ->4L VALUE
    - Run 2:
        - H->2gamma VALUE
        - (2016) H->ZZ->4L VALUE
        - H->bb
        - H->mumu
        - H->WW 

- Why this thesis is important:
    - This thesis describes the methodology and results of the best precision measurement of mH to date by using the hZZ4l decay and Full Run 2 data set from CMS.
    - Run 2 provides more data -> more precision on measurements of Higgs properties.
    - In addition to more HZZ4l events, this analysis provides new techniques, specifically the VX constraint.
    - Predict mH for Run 3, will start soon summer 2022 and provide an approximate 300? /fb of L int.
    - In 2026(?), HLLHC provides even more data. ref snowmass paper.

This chapter is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item General overview of the ingredients of the Higgs boson mass measurement (Section~\ref{sec:analysis_overview}).
    \item Data sets and simulated samples (Section~\ref{sec:datasets}).
    \item Object reconstruction (Section~\ref{sec:datasets})
    \item Event selection (Section~\ref{sec:datasets})
\end{itemize}

SEEMS TO BE A GOOD INTRO. Should it be the intro for the entire thesis?
