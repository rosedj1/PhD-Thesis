\section{Matrix Element-based Kinematic Discriminant}
\label{sec:Dkin}
The \Dkinbkg is the last variable that is used to extract the value of \mH.
It is a discriminant sensitive to the kinematical variables of the \qqggzzfourl process and is useful in \emph{discriminating} a signal process from a background process.
% TODO: Define \Dkinbkg.
% TODO: More info in :CITE HIG-19-001.

%\subsection{\Dkinbkg with new muon reconstruction}
%This section will show the possible impact of the new muon reconstruction on the \Dkinbkg.

\subsection{Correlation studies}
\label{sec:DkinCorrelation}
The previous \mH measurement
% TODO:CITE
was obtained assuming no correlation between \relmfourlerrflat and \Dkinbkg.
% TODO: Maybe define relmass4lerr as $D_{m_{4\ell}}$ 
However, \figurename~\ref{Dkin_sigma_correlation} shows $D_{m_{4\ell}} \left( \relmfourlerr \right)$ \vs \Dkinbkg for events that pass full selection, split by final state and by year---a correlation is indeed observed.
Categorizing events by \relmfourlerrflat eliminates this dependence.

% \subsection{Methodology}
So far, the uncertainties on \mH have been estimated by performing a 1D likelihood fit on \mfourl after implementing the various analysis techniques (Sec.~\ref{sec:techniques}).
To achieve an even lower uncertainty on the final \mH value, a 2D likelihood fit can be performed, incorporating \Dkinbkg into the fit.
The new pdf used to extract the uncertainties on \mH is:
\[
pdf(m'_{4\ell}, \Dkinbkg) = f(m_{4\ell}) \times g(\Dkinbkg, m'_{4\ell}),
\]
for which lepton \pt values have been updated using VX+BS and \Zone refit in each category.

\figurename~\ref{2D_distribution} shows example of the 2D histograms of the g function, for 2018 ggF sample @ 125 \GeV
for different bins and for different final states.

As was the case for the signal processes, the backgrounds described in Sec: \ref{sec:BackgroundEstimation} are split into different relative mass error bins and are fitted using a 3rd order Bernstein polynomial function.

\subsection{Expected mass measurement uncertainties (MC)}
Expected results (in \MeV), when implementing the \Dkinbkg in the likelihood, 
are summarized in Tables~\ref{table:N2D_model_result} and~\ref{table:N2D_model_result_year}.
