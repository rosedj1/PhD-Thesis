\section{Matrix Element-based Kinematic Discriminant}
\label{sec:Dkin}
The kinematic discriminant $\left( \Dkinbkg \right)$ is sensitive to the kinematical variables of the \qqggzzfourl process and is useful in \emph{discriminating} a signal process from a background process~\cite{HIG_19_001}.
It is the final variable used to extract the value of \mH.

\subsection{Correlation Studies}
\label{sec:DkinCorrelation}
The \mH measurement performed by CMS using 2016 Run 2 data was obtained assuming no correlation between \relmfourlerrflat and \Dkinbkg~\cite{HIG_16_041}.
% TODO: Maybe define relmass4lerr as $D_{m_{4\ell}}$ 
% TODO: REWORD.
However, \cref{Dkin_sigma_correlation} shows $D_{m_{4\ell}} \left( \relmfourlerr \right)$ \vs \Dkinbkg for events that pass full selection, split by final state and by year---a correlation is indeed observed.
Categorizing events by \relmfourlerrflat eliminates this dependence.

% \subsection{Methodology}
So far, the uncertainties on \mH have been estimated by performing a 1D likelihood fit on \mfourl after implementing the various analysis techniques (Sec.~\ref{sec:techniques}).
To achieve an even lower uncertainty on the final \mH value, a 2D likelihood fit can be performed, incorporating \Dkinbkg into the fit.
The new pdf used to extract the uncertainties on \mH is:
\[
\text{pdf}(m'_{4\ell}, \Dkinbkg) = f(m_{4\ell}) \times g(\Dkinbkg, m'_{4\ell}),
\]
for which lepton \pt values have been updated using VXBS and \Zone refit in each category.

\Cref{2D_distribution} shows values of the $g$ function binned across two dimensions (\Dkinbkg \vs \relmfourlerrflat), for 2018 ggH events assuming $\mh = 125\GeV$,
for different bins in each final state.

As was the case for the signal processes, the backgrounds described in Sec.~\ref{sec:BackgroundEstimation} are split into different relative mass error bins and are fitted using a 3rd order Bernstein polynomial function.

\subsection{Expected mass measurement uncertainties (MC)}
Expected results (in \MeV), when implementing the \Dkinbkg in the likelihood, 
are summarized in Tables~\ref{table:N2D_model_result} and~\ref{table:N2D_model_result_year}.
