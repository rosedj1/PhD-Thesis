\section{Data Sets, Simulated Samples, and Triggers}
The data sets used for the search for low-mass dilepton mass resonances in SM Higgs boson decays uses the same data sets for all three years (2016--2018) as those found in Ref.~\ref{}.
A brief explanation of the parameters used to generate the data sets follows next.

The physics processes corresponding to the signal $\pp \to \htozzd \left( \zdzd \right) \to \fourl$, where $\ell = (\Pe, \Pmu)$, were generated at leading order (LO) using \MGvATNLO 2.2.2 (2.4.2) for 2016 (2017, 2018) samples using the parameters set by the HAHM.
On the other hand, \POWHEG v2 was used to simulate the production of SM Higgs bosons via the typical processes (ggH, VBF, VH, and \ttbarh) and to simulate \qqzz at next-to-leading order (NLO) using perturbative quantum chromodynamics (Refs.~\cite{frixione_matching_2007, bagnaschi_higgs_2012, alioli_general_2010,nason_new_2004}).
The other irreducible background process \ggzz was simulated using \MCFM 7.0.1 (Ref.~\cite{mcfm_campbell_precision_2019}) at LO, to which NLO correction factors were applied (Ref.~\cite{nlo_corr_grazzini_fully_2018}).
The simulation of \htofourl was carried out by the software \JHUGEN 7.0.2 (Refs.~\cite{hdecay_gao_spin_2010, hdecay_bolognesi_spin_2012}).
