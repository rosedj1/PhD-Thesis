\chapter{SEARCH FOR LOW-MASS DILEPTON RESONANCES IN THE \texorpdfstring{\htofourl}{H TO 4l} CHANNEL}

% Need to use \texorpdfstring{} so it also shows in pdf bookmarks.

\section{Motivation}
Although the Higgs boson has been thoroughly studied and \emph{appears} to be consistent with the SM Higgs boson (Sec.~\ref{sec:higgs_motivation}), a single experiment that shows BSM activity (\ie \emph{any} deviation from SM prediction) is all that is required to defenestrate this idea.
For example, it may be the case that the Higgs boson (\PH) decays into particles other than those found within the scope of the SM.
This chapter details such an analysis, which follows similar topologies to the one studied in Chapter~\ref{ch:higgs_mass} (\hzzfourl), specifically \hzxfourl and \hxxfourl, where \PX is a BSM low-mass dilepton resonance~\cite{CMS:2021pcy}.
