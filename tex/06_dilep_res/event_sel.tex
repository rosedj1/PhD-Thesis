\section{Event Selection}
\label{sec:evt_sel_dilep}
The logic of the event selection to identify \htozzd or \htozdzd events is very similar to the event selection described in Sec.~\ref{sec:evt_sel}.
However, the main differences are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item each dilepton candidate is required to fall outside the $\varUpsilon$ mass window: $8.0 < \mass{\varUpsilon} < 11.5\GeV$
    \item because of the limited kinematical phase space in the \zdzd search, $4 < \mZtwo < 62.5\GeV$
    \item to select \zdzd candidates, the smallest value of $(\mZone - \mZtwo)/(\mZone + \mZtwo)$ is chosen
\end{itemize}

TODO: Instead of comparing this event selection to Higgs mass selection, perhaps just lay everything out clearly step-by-step?
