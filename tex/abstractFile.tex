% THOUGHTS: Maybe it does, actually... By NOT using a math env, the equals symbol looks different, of course.
% Right now I think that inside math env looks better.

Expectations of the total uncertainty are placed on the Higgs boson mass $(\mH)$ in the \hzzfourl ($\ell = \Pe, \Pmu$) decay channel.
The value of \mH, with statistical and systematic uncertainties, is estimated to be $\mH = 125.38 \pm 0.11\left[0.11\stat \pm 0.02\syst \right]\GeV$.
Once the data are unblinded, this measurement is predicted to be the world's most precise measurement of \mH to date.
The data considered for the analysis were produced from proton--proton (\pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider with a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV during Run 2 (2016--2018), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \lumiruntwo, and were collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment.

% This expected uncertainties  for this measurement uses improved analysis techniques such as
% the separate analysis  four different final states $(\)$ individually,
% implementing a vertex$+$beamspot constraint in which the final state muon tracks are constrained to originate from a vertex that is compatible with the luminous region,

Using data sets from the same LHC run period, a search for low-mass dilepton resonances in Higgs boson decays to the \fourl final state is also conducted.
The Hidden Abelian Higgs Model is considered to search for a beyond the Standard Model dark photon (\PZD) particle.
Constraints are placed at 95\% confidence level (CL) on the Higgs-mixing parameter $\kappa < 4 \times \tentotheminus{4}$ and also on the products of the branching fractions $\brof{\htozzd}$, $\brof{\htozdzd}$, and $\brof{\zdtoeepmormumupm}$.
No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed.
