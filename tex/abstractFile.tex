% Abstract-- passive voice, present tense

% UF says:
% Abstracts for doctoral dissertations must not be more than 350 words.
% Should be a concise summary of your dissertation’s or thesis’ study and purpose, fully understandable without reference to the dissertation or thesis itself.
% Your abstract should not contain any parenthetical or bracketed references.
% TODO: The math environment here doesn't produce true math symbols, like "=" or "\pm". Why?
% THOUGHTS: Maybe it does, actually... By NOT using a math env, the equals symbol looks different, of course.
% Right now I think that inside math env looks better.
% Possibly look into the way \sqrt looks!
Expectations of the total uncertainty are placed on the Higgs boson mass $(\mH)$ in the \hzzfourl ($\ell = \Pe, \Pmu$) decay channel.
The value of \mH, including statistical and systematic uncertainties, is estimated to be $\mH = 125.38 \pm 0.11\left[0.11\stat \pm 0.02\syst \right]\GeV$.
Once the data are unblinded, this measurement is predicted to be the world's most precise measurement of \mH to date.
The data used in the analysis were produced by proton--proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV during Run 2 (2016--2018), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \lumiruntwo, and were collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment.
The uncertainties on \mH are improved by constraining the reconstructed muon tracks to the luminous region (\emph{vertex$+$beamspot constraint}).

Using data sets from the same LHC run period, a search for low-mass dilepton resonances in Higgs boson decays to the \fourl final state is also conducted.
The Hidden Abelian Higgs Model is used in the search for a beyond the Standard Model dark photon (\PZD) particle.
Constraints are placed at 95\% confidence level on the Higgs-mixing parameter $\kappa < 4 \times \tentotheminus{4}$ and also on the products of the branching fractions $\brof{\htozzd}$, $\brof{\htozdzd}$, and $\brof{\zdtoeepmormumupm}$ for $\mass{\PZD} > 4\GeV$.
The branching fractions consider flavor-symmetric decays of \PZD to dielectrons and dimuons, exclusive decays of \PZD to dielectrons, and exclusive decays of \PZD to dimuons.
No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed.
