The mass of the Higgs boson is measured in the \hzzfourl decay channel (where $\ell$ is an electron or muon) and is found to be TODO:MASS---the world's best measurement to date. 
The data for the measurement, which were obtained from proton-proton (\pp) collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider during Run 2 (2016--2018) at a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV, were analyzed by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment and correspond to an integrated luminosity of \lumiruntwo.
The measurement uses an improved analysis technique in which the final state muon tracks are constrainted to originate from the primary \pp vertex.
Using the same data sets, a search for low-mass dilepton resonances in Higgs boson decays to the \fourl final state is also conducted.
No significant deviation from the standard model prediction is observed.
