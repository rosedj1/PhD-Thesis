The mass of the Higgs boson is measured in the \hzzfourl
($\ell = \Pe, \mu$) %(where $\ell$ is an electron or muon)
decay channel and is found to be $\mH = 125.38 \pm 0.11\GeV$;

the world's most precise measurement to date. 
The data for the measurement were produced from proton-proton (\pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider with a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV during Run 2 (2016--2018), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \lumiruntwo, and were collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment.
This measurement uses an improved analysis technique in which the final state muon tracks are constrainted to originate from the primary \pp vertex.
Using data sets from the same run, a search for low-mass dilepton resonances in Higgs boson decays to the \fourl final state is also conducted.
No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed.
