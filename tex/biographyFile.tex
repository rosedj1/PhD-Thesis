% This is the ``biographical sketch" tex file, which should have been set in the main file using the command \verb|\setBiographicalFile{Drive:/file/location/biographyFile}|.

% Keep in mind this should be written in \textbf{third person} and should assume you have already completed your degree that you are writing this thesis or dissertation for. 
% For example:

% Jason is a person that wrote some code, did some research, and eventually got a PhD in mathematics for some stuff.
% He had to actually write a real biographical sketch because he had forgotten to do it until final submission.
Jake Rosenzweig had the best childhood anyone could ask for, growing up in Jacksonville, FL: enjoying video games with excellent friends, playing football on the beach, and having plenty of opportunity to make mistakes.
He graduated from the University of Florida in 2011 with a B.S. in chemistry, while maintaining his sanity by getting minors in education and Latin.
He subsequently lost his sanity in 2022 while earning his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Florida.
He enjoys building things from scrap, weightlifting, hiking in the Coloradoan mountains, gardening, silence, and---most of all---receiving the beleaguered stare from his wife after telling her a \emph{particularly} bad dad joke.
