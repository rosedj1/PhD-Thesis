This is the ``biographical sketch" tex file, which should have been set in the main file using the command \verb|\setBiographicalFile{Drive:/file/location/biographyFile}|.

Keep in mind this should be written in \textbf{third person} and should assume you have already completed your degree that you are writing this thesis or dissertation for. 
For example:

Jason is a person that wrote some code, did some research, and eventually got a PhD in mathematics for some stuff. He had to actually write a real biographical sketch because he had forgotten to do it until final submission.
