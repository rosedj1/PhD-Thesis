% The importance of measuring the mass of the Higgs boson 
Using data collected by the CMS detector, the mass of the Higgs boson was measured to be $\mH = 125.38 \pm 0.11\GeV$;
the world's most precise measurement to date.
This measurement studied the \hzzfourl ($\ell = \Pe, \mu$) decay channel and used LHC Run 2 data from \pp collisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \lumiruntwo.
The analysis improved upon previous measurements of \mH by constraining muon tracks to the primary vertex (\emph{vertex constraint}).
